1. Set the following environment variables

* FIO_ROOT should be set to the directory containing this README
  file

* FIO_ARCH should be set to a string describing the build
  environment (for example "OSX")

* FIO_INSTALL_DIR should be set to the location where files will be
  installed.  Files will be installed under
  $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include, $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib, and
  $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/bin.


2. Create and edit the file $FIO_ROOT/install/make.inc.$FIO_ARCH
   to specify the proper compilers and library paths.  An example
   using the gnu compilers can be found in
   $FIO_ROOT/install/make.inc.OSX .

   You will need an installation of HDF5, MPI, and LAPACK


3. Run "make" from $FIO_ROOT


4. Run "make install" from $FIO_ROOT.  This will install:
   
   Executables in     $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/
   Libraries in       $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib/
   Headers in         $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include/
   Fortran modules in $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include/
