1. Set the environment variables FIO_ROOT, FIO_ARCH, FIO_INSTALL_DIR, and PYTHON

* FIO_ROOT should be set to the directory containing this README
  file

* FIO_ARCH should be set to a string describing the build
  environment (for example "OSX")

* FIO_INSTALL_DIR should be set to the location where files will be
  installed.  Files will be installed under
  $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include, $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib, and
  $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/bin.

* PYTHON should be set to the python executable. for examplye python3 (python2 is 
  close to getting deprecated)


2. Create and edit the file $FIO_ROOT/install/make.inc.$FIO_ARCH
   to specify the proper compilers and library paths.  An example
   using the gnu compilers can be found in
   $FIO_ROOT/install/make.inc.OSX .

   You will need an installation of HDF5, MPI, and LAPACK

   If compiling on Portal: ACML_HOME should also be changed to: /usr/pppl/acml/5.3.1
   If compiling on eddy, the INCLUDE path might be incorrectly set (missing an -I 
   in front of the first entry. export INCLUDE=-I$INCLUDE should fix it. 


3. From $FIO_ROOT
   make : builds static libraries and executables
   make shared : builds shared libraries
   make python : builds fio_py.so


4. Run "make install" from $FIO_ROOT.  This will install:
   
   Executables in     $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/bin/
   Libraries in       $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib/
   Headers in         $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include/
   Fortran modules in $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/include/

5. To run the code add the following paths to your bashrc:
    PATH:             $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/bin
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH:  $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib
    PYTHONPATH:       $FIO_INSTALL_DIR/lib
